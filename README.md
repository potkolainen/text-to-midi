# Needed Packages for the script
python script uses  !!!OPEN SOURCE!!! packages that are needed for running the script or .exe so far
| Rank | Packages  |
|-----:|-----------|
|     1| Python3.11|
|     2| mido      |
|     3| pyperclip |

Rest are invluded in standard python library.
For me it helped when i installed Python from microsoft store. My cmd terminal didnt find the one i installed first from python.org

once python 3.11 is installed open your windows command terminal
type:
pip install mido
pip install pyperclip

# .exe
includes also .exe file (this for now needs pyhon and packages installed, i will fix this later)
